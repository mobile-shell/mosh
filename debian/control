Description: Mobile shell that supports roaming and intelligent local echo
 Mosh is a remote terminal application that supports:
   - intermittent network connectivity,
   - roaming to different IP address without dropping the connection, and
   - intelligent local echo and line editing to reduce the effects
     of "network lag" on high-latency connections.
